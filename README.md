I'm using a lot of this other code: https://github.com/slyautomation/osrs_yolov5
I modified it to serve to my purposes and tasks.
Train your model with this google colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ItmO7zZeZG4dNnn_AcrVDkv9hpmxws4?usp=sharing (MAKE SURE TO USE GPU IN SETTINGS)
You need your own datasets, put them in a folder under the datasets folder. Change osrs.yaml under data to fit your classes and all that.
There are small errors with it, like in main.py change the back slashes to forward slashes.
That's it and enjoy your automation!
